# Roadmap

The v1 priority is a reliable Rust CLI for local commit generation through `aic`.

## High Impact

- ~~**`aic log` — rewrite past commit messages**~~ — ✅ clean up the last N commit messages on a branch using AI before opening a PR.
- ~~**`aic review` — AI-powered diff review**~~ — ✅ get feedback on the staged diff (bugs, style, security) using a review-focused prompt and the existing provider infrastructure.
- ~~**Shell completion generation**~~ — ✅ `aic completions <shell>` subcommand added via `clap_complete`.

## Medium Impact, Low Effort

- ~~**`--dry-run` flag**~~ — ✅ generate and display the commit message without committing.
- ~~**`--amend` flag**~~ — ✅ regenerate and amend the last commit message.
- ~~**Branch name as context**~~ — ✅ ticket/issue numbers extracted from branch names and fed into the prompt.
- ~~**Conventional commit scope hints**~~ — ✅ detect likely scopes from changed file paths and feed them into the prompt to improve scope consistency.
- ~~**Commit message history**~~ — ✅ local log of generated messages and reviews (`~/.aicommit-history.json`) with `aic history` to browse them.
- ~~**CLI help coverage**~~ — ✅ richer top-level and nested `--help` output, with shared metadata for help text, shell completions, and `aic config describe`.

## Medium Impact, Moderate Effort

- ~~**`aic pr` — PR description generation**~~ — ✅ generate a pull request title and description from the branch's commits and cumulative diff against the base branch.
- ~~**Interactive diff splitting**~~ — ✅ analyze one staged change set, suggest file-based commit groups, preview one message per group, and create multiple commits sequentially.
- **Config profiles** — named profiles (`~/.aicommit.d/work.toml`, `~/.aicommit.d/personal.toml`) selectable via `--profile` or auto-detected from the git remote URL.
- Commitlint-style config inference.

## Quality of Life

- **`aic init`** — generate a `.aicommitignore` with sensible defaults for the detected project type.
- **Cost estimation** — show estimated token usage and approximate cost before sending to the API.
- **Clipboard copy option** — add "Copy to clipboard" alongside Yes/No/Edit in the confirmation prompt.
- **`--quiet` / `--json` output mode** — output only the generated message to stdout for piping into other tools.
- Broader language prompt examples.
- Release packaging for common package managers.
