# aicommit

A fast, opinionated CLI that generates Git commit messages and reviews staged diffs using AI. Written in Rust, installed as `aic`.

## Quick start

```sh
# Install via Homebrew (macOS)
brew install russmckendrick/tap/aicommit

# Or download a binary from GitHub Releases
# https://github.com/russmckendrick/aicommit/releases

# Run setup to configure your provider and credentials
aic setup
```

## Usage

Stage your changes and run `aic` — it generates a conventional commit message, shows it for confirmation, and commits on approval:

```sh
git add -p
aic
```

If nothing is staged, `aic` lets you stage all changed files, choose files interactively, or cancel.

### Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-c`, `--context` | Add context for the AI (e.g., `-c "closes #42"`) |
| `-y`, `--yes` | Skip the confirmation prompt |
| `-d`, `--dry-run` | Print the message without committing |
| `--amend` | Regenerate and amend the last commit |
| `--fgm` | Use the full GitMoji specification |

### Review staged changes

Get AI-powered feedback on your staged diff before committing — findings are grouped by severity and rendered in the terminal:

```sh
aic review
aic review -c "focus on security"
```

### Rewrite commit messages

Clean up the last N commit messages on your branch before opening a PR:

```sh
aic log
aic log -n 3
```

### Draft a pull request

Generate a PR title and Markdown description from the branch commits and diff against a base branch:

```sh
aic pr
aic pr --base origin/main
aic pr -c "highlight rollout risk"
aic pr --yes
```

### Browse history

View recent AI-generated commit messages, PR drafts, and reviews:

```sh
aic history                  # interactive by default in a terminal
aic history --non-interactive
aic history --all
aic history --verbose
aic history --kind review
```

### More commands

```sh
aic setup                  # Interactive provider setup
aic config set KEY=value   # Set configuration
aic models --refresh       # List available models
aic hook set               # Install prepare-commit-msg hook
aic completions zsh        # Generate shell completions
```
